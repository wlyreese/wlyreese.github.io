## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid Area
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS Grid-Template-Area is a tool i've wanted to try out for a little while. It works wonders when making responsive grids because you can simply make a new template at a different screen size and make a few minor adjustments and your grid is much easier to work with.

I also learned how to use TTF files in CSS for the first time, as this is my first coding project, it was nice to learn how many different ways fonts can be used.

HTML line breaks (<br>) can be toggled on and off with the display property.

### Continued development

Keeping my code clean and not copying code in media queries, managing code across screen sizes can be tricky if not organized properly.
